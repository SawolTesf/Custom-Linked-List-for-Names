# Custom Linked List for Names

Welcome to the Java Custom Linked List for Names project! This project is a Java-based application that creates a custom linked list structure specifically designed for storing and managing names.

## Project Description

The Java Custom Linked List for Names is a backend application that implements a unique linked list structure. The structure stores names in a sorted order and supports operations like adding a name, removing a name or a letter, finding a name, and printing the list.

## Key Features

- **Custom Linked List**: Utilizes a custom linked list to dynamically store and manage names.
- **Name Management**: Allows users to add and remove names from the list.
- **Letter Management**: Provides functionality to remove a letter and all names associated with it.
- **Name Search**: Offers a search function to find a name in the list.
- **List Display**: Displays the list in a user-friendly format.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Advanced Java Programming**: Showcases advanced programming concepts like linked lists, nested classes, and object-oriented programming.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that user data falls within the proper range and prevents users from adding invalid names.
- **User Interface Design**: Presents a user-friendly interface for managing the list.

## Technical Details

The Java Custom Linked List for Names is developed using Java. It employs a custom linked list structure to store and manage names based on user inputs.

## How to Use

To use this program, you need to have Java installed on your machine. Once you have Java installed, you can run the program using the following command:

java Namelist < input.txt

Replace input.txt with the path to your input file. The input file should contain the commands for the program to execute.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance the app with the following features:

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts for personalized experiences.
- **Multiple Lists**: Extend the system to handle multiple lists.
- **Advanced Name Management**: Provide an option for users to select non-sequential names or names from different letters.
